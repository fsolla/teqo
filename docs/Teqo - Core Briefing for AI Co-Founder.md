## Closing Note

Teqo is not a wallet for everyone, it is a wallet for those who seek **intentional, sovereign ownership** of their digital assets.  
**Flow, clarity, and dignity** in the experience matter as much as the code.  
Every design and product decision must be aligned with this principle.
